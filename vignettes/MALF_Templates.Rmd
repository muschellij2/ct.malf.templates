# Where is the Data located?

The `ct_malf_images` is the general workhorse function for returning the data from the MALF templates.  

```{r}
mi = ct_malf_images()
names(mi)
```
 The return is a list of filenames, broken into `images` (raw T1-weighted scans) and
 <!-- ,  -->
 <!-- `labels` (delineated labeled structures),  -->
 <!-- `brains` (processed T1-weighted images, skull-stripped),  -->
 `masks` (binary brain masks).
 

## Derivative Functions

The `ct_malf_template_images`, `ct_malf_template_labels`, `ct_malf_template_brains`, `ct_malf_template_masks` functions all call `ct_malf_images` and take the relevant element of the list for easier use.


## MASS Derivatives
The `ct_mass_images` function was created.  It simply returns the 
images and the brain masks.  Generally, these are used for MASS (multi-atlas skull stripping), which is a bit more specific (but more widely-applicable) applicatio of label fusion:

```{r}
mi = ct_mass_images()
names(mi)
head(ct_mass_template_images())
head(ct_mass_template_masks())
```

The large difference is that `ct_mass_images` (and the derivative functions) simply take the `n_templates` argument for the number of templates to return (from 1 to 35).  

## What to use them with?

Using the `extrantsr::malf` function, these functions can be used for MALF.  The images/brain images are passed into the `template.images` argument and the structures/brain masks are passed into the `template.structs` argument. 
### Why have you not shown me a MALF example?

We have not included this code in the vignettes due to install times for `extrantsr` as a `Suggests` package.
